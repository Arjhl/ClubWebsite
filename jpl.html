          The Mars Helicopter Scout (MHS) is a planned robotic helicopter that
          tests the technology to scout interesting targets for study on Mars,
          and it helps plan the best driving route for future Mars rovers. The
          Mars Helicopter Scout (MHS) is a technology demonstrator by JPL that
          assesses whether this technology can fly safely. It provides better
          mapping and guidance that would give future mission controllers more
          information to help with travel routes planning and hazard avoidance,
          as well as identifying points of interest for the rover. The
          helicopter provides overhead images with approximately ten times
          greater resolution than orbital images, and displays features that may
          be occluded from the rover cameras. This technology forms the
          foundation on which more capable helicopters can be developed for
          aerial exploration of Mars and other planetary targets with an
          atmosphere.

          The helicopter uses counter-rotating coaxial rotors about 1.1 m in
          diameter. Its payload is a high resolution downward-looking camera for
          navigation, landing, and science surveying of the terrain, and a
          communication system to relay data to the Mars rover. Although it is
          an aircraft, it is being constructed as a spacecraft in order to
          endure the gravitational force and vibration during launch. It also
          includes radiation-resistant systems capable of operating in the
          frigid environment of Mars. The inconsistent Mars magnetic field
          precludes the use of a compass for navigation, so it uses a solar
          tracker camera integrated to JPLâ€™s visual inertial navigation system.
          Some additional inputs include gyros, visual odometry, tilt sensors,
          altimeter, and hazard detectors. It uses solar panels to recharge its
          batteries, which are six Sony Li-ion cells with a nameplate capacity
          of 2 Ah. <br /><br />
          The prototype uses the Snapdragon processor from Intrinsyc with a
          Linux operating system, which also implements visual navigation via a
          velocity estimate derived from features tracked with a camera. The
          processor is connected to two flight-control Microcontroller Units
          (MCU) to perform the needed flight-control functions. Communications
          with the rover are through a radio link called Zig-Bee, a standard 900
          MHz chipset that will be mounted in both the rover and helicopter. The
          communication system is designed to relay data at 250 Kbit/s over
          distances of up to 1,000 m. The helicoptertravels by attaching to the
          underside of the rover, and is deployed to the surface between 60 and
          90 Martian days after the landing. Then, the rover will drive
          approximately 100 meters away for the test flights to begin. This
          technology demonstration forms the foundation on which more capable
          helicopters can be developed for more ambitious missions to planets
          and moons with an atmosphere. The next generation of rotorcraft may be
          in the range between 5 and 15 kg with science payloads between 0.5 and
          1.5 kg. These potential aircraft could have direct communication to an
          orbiter and may or may not continue to work with a landed asset.
          Future helicopters could be used to explore special regions with
          exposed water ice or brines where Earth microbial life could
          potentially survive. Mars helicopters may also be considered for fast
          retrieval of small sample caches back to a Mars ascent vehicle for
          return to Earth.
