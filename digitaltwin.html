          A Digital Twin is a virtual representation that serves as the
          real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process. The
          concept was first introduced in 2002 by Michael Grieves at the
          University of Michigan. The first practical definition of digital twin
          originated from NASA in an attempt to improve the physical model
          simulation of a spacecraft in 2010. NASA continues to heavily use
          digital twins for its space exploration initiatives including its
          rovers on Mars. Digital twins were until very recently limited to the
          aerospace and heavy machinery market, but this is changing and there
          are now a variety of use cases in diverse sectors such as smart
          cities, healthcare, insurance and utilities.

        <h2 class="subhead">HOW IT WORKS?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          There are three tests to certify a virtual copy to be a true digital
          copy: First is the vision test where the virtual visual inspection
          would include disassembling the product and seeing completely
          realistic representations of its component parts; second is showing
          that the virtual product reacts realistically to testing, such as a
          digital wind tunnel or simulated tests; and the third test is about
          getting information from the virtual product through a physical
          inspection, just as a user would from an actual product. This coupling
          of the virtual and physical worlds allows analysis of data, monitoring
          of systems, and simulation of real-world conditions to proactively
          respond to changes, prevent downtime, improve operations, and develop
          new revenue models. Digital twin technology covers the entire
          lifecycle of the product or service from conceptualization till it
          retires. The genesis of digital twin was in the form of 3D CAD models
          designed for the new product introduction. However, the proliferation
          of digital levers like cloud connectivity, IoT, augmented reality
          (AR), and machine intelligence provided a significant momentum for
          large-scale implementation of digital twins in various industries. The
          digital twin has all the real-time performance data, sensor data, and
          inspection data along with the history of the maintenance performed,
          configuration changes, parts replacement, and warranty data, leading
          to reduced lifecycle ownership cost of the asset and valuable product
          intelligence for superior product innovation.

        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="subhead">Space Sector</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          NASA was first to apply the concept of digital twin in the space
          sector in the 1970s during the Apollo 13 program, where engineers on
          the ground needed to be able to rapidly account for changes to their
          vehicle while being exposed to the extreme conditions in space, and
          with lives on the line.

        <h2 class="subhead">Manufacturing</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Digital Twin is poised to change the current face of the manufacturing
          sector. Digital Twins have a significant impact on the way products
          are designed, manufactured and maintained. It makes manufacturing more
          efficient and optimized while reducing the throughput times. Digital
          Twins can be used in the automobile sector for creating the virtual
          model of a connected vehicle. It captures the behavioural and
          operational data of the vehicle and helps in analysing the overall
          vehicle performance as well as the connected features. Digital Twins
          also helps in better in store planning, security implementation and
          energy management in an optimized manner.

        <h2 class="subhead">Smart Cities</h2>

        <p class="desc">
          The smart city planning and implementation with Digital Twins and IoT
          data helps enhancing economic development, efficient management of
          resources, reduction of ecological foot print and increase the overall
          quality of a citizen's life. The digital twin model can help city
          planners and policymakers in the smart city planning by gaining the
          insights from various sensor networks and intelligent systems. The
          data from the digital twins help them in arriving at informed
          decisions regarding the future as well.

        <h2 class="subhead">Health Care</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          A patient's digital twin is designed to capture continuous data from
          the individual about various vitals, medical condition, response to
          the drug, therapy, and surrounding ecosystem. Each patient's data is
          stored at Azure or AWS public cloud and fed to the Digital Twin
          platform. Historical and real-time data of each patient helps ML
          algorithm to predict future health conditions. With lifestyle, daily
          food habits and blood sugar data of a chronic diabetes patient, the
          model alerts the patient for medications, food habit changes, doctor
          consultation etc. Thus, Digital Twin leverages a large amount of rich
          data from various IoMT devices and uses AI-powered models to develop
          more personalized and better care plans.

        <h2 class="subhead">ADVANTAGES</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          - Accelerated risk assessment and production time <br />
          - Predictive maintenance <br />
          - Real-time remote monitoring <br />
          - Better team collaboration <br />
          - Better financial decision-making <br />
        </p>

        <h2 class="subhead">DISADVANTAGES</h2>

        <p class="desc">
          - The success of this technology is dependent on internet
          connectivity. <br />
          - The security is at stake. <br />
          - The digital twin concept is based on 3D CAD models and not on 2D
          drawings. <br />
          - Digital twin will be required across entire supply chains. <br />
          - The challenges involved here include globalization and new
          manufacturing techniques. Managing all these design data for digital
          twin among partners and suppliers as the physical product evolves will
          be a challenge. <br />

          Digital twins have become important to business today. By producing a
          replica of the physical assets of a product or service in an Industry,
          digital twin helps in analysing the data, lends a platform to check
          the functioning beforehand so as to develop a solution for any
          potential problems.
