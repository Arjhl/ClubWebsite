          Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair
          or group of particles generated, interact, or share spatial proximity
          in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the pair or
          group cannot be described independently of the state of the others,
          including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The
          topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between
          classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of
          quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics.

          LATEST BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FIELD OF QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT
        </h2>
        <p class="desc">
          - In experiments in 2012 and 2013, polarization correlation was
          created between photons that never coexisted in time. <br />
          - In three independent experiments in 2013 it was shown that
          classically communicated separable quantum states can be used to carry
          entangled states.The first loophole-free Bell test was held in TU
          Delft in 2015 confirming the violation of Bell inequality. <br />
          - In 2015, Markus Greiner's group at Harvard performed a direct
          measurement of Renyi entanglement in a system of ultra cold bosonic
          atoms. <br />
          - From 2016 various companies like IBM, Microsoft etc. have
          successfully created quantum computers and allowed developers and tech
          enthusiasts to openly experiment with concepts of quantum mechanics
          including quantum entanglement. <br />

        <h2 class="subhead">WHAT IS QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs ridiculous
          when a pair or group of particles are generated, interact, or share
          spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each
          particle of the pair or group cannot be described independently of the
          state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a
          large distance.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">HISTORY</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          The counter intuitive predictions of quantum mechanics about strongly
          correlated systems were first discussed by Albert Einstein in 1935, in
          a joint paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. In this study,the
          three formulated the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox(EPRparadox),a
          thought experiment that attempted to show that"the quantum-mechanical
          description of physical reality given by wave functions is not
          complete."However, the three scientists did not coin the word
          entanglement,nor did they generalize the special properties of the
          state they considered. Following the EPRpaper, Erwin Schrödinger wrote
          a letter to Einstein in German in which he used the word Verschränkung
          to describe the correlations between two particles that interact and
          then separate, as in the EPR experiment."John Stewart Bell proved that
          one of their key assumptions, the principle of locality, as applied to
          the kind of hidden variables interpretation hoped for by EPR, was
          mathematically inconsistent with the predictions of quantum theory.

        <h2 class="subhead">SCHRÖDINGER'S CAT THEORY</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          One can even set up quite rediculous cases. A cat is penned up in a
          steel chamber, along with the following device(which must be secured
          against direct interference by the cat):in a Geiger counter, there is
          a tiny bit of radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the
          course of the hour one of the atoms decays,but also, with equal
          probability, perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges
          and through a relay releases a hammer that shatters a small flask of
          hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an
          hour, one would say that the cat still lives if mean while no atom has
          decayed.The first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The
          psi-function of the entire system would express this by having in it
          the living and dead cat(pardon the expression)mixed or smeared out
          inequal parts.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">HIDDEN VARIABLE THEORY</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          A possible resolution to the paradox is to assume that quantum theory
          is in complete, and the result of measurements depends on
          predetermined "hidden variables". The state of the particles being
          measured contains some hidden variables, whose values effectively
          determine, right from the moment of separation, what the out comes of
          the spin measurements are going to be.This would mean that each
          particle carries all the required information with it, and nothing
          needs to be transmitted from one particle to the other at the time of
          measurement. Einstein and others(see the previous section) originally
          believed this was the only way out of the paradox, and the accepted
          quantum mechanical description(with a random measurement outcome)must
          be incomplete.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">VIOLATIONS OF BELL'S INEQUALITY</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Local hidden variable theories fail, however, when measurements of the
          spin of entangled particles along different axes are considered. If a
          large number of pairs of such measurements are made(on a large number
          of pairs of entangled particles),then statistically, if the local
          realist or hidden variables view were correct, the results would
          always satisfy Bell's inequality.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subhead">NATURALLY ENTANGLED SYSTEMS</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          The electron shells of multi-electron atoms always consist of
          entangled electrons. The correct ionization energy can be calculated
          only by consideration of electron entanglement.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          To conclude with, I would like to propose a more wide-ranging
          theoretical task to arrive at a set of principles like energy and
          momentum conservation, but which apply to information, and from which
          much of quantum mechanics could be derived. Two tests of such ideas
          would be whether the EPR-Bell correlations thus became transparent,
          and whether they rendered obvious the proper use of terms such as
          'measurement' and 'knowledge'.
