          Relationship psychologists have shown that peopleâ€™s trust in
          artificial intelligence (AI) is tied to their relationship or
          attachment style. As progress in traditional computing slows, new
          forms of computing are coming to the forefront. A team of engineers
          are attempting to pioneer a type of computing that mimics the
          efficiency of the brainâ€™s neural networks while exploiting the brainâ€™s
          analog nature.Scientists have discovered a new way to connect human
          brains to computers - through veins.

        <h2 class="subhead">WHAT IS NEURALINK?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Neuralink is a device that will be surgically implanted into your
          brain and with it, youâ€™ll be able to communicate with machines and
          even control them. It will also help study the electrical signals in
          the brain and arrive at solutions that can help cure various medical
          problems. With Neuralink a chipset, called N1 chipset, will be
          installed in your skull which is 8mm in diameter and has multiple
          wires housing electrodes and insulation for the wires.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h2 class="subhead">HOW DOES NEURALINK WORK?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Your brain sends information to different parts of your body using
          neurons. These neurons in your brain connect with each other to form a
          large network and communicate using chemical signals called
          neurotransmitters. This reaction generates an electric field and you
          can record these reactions by placing electrodes nearby.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">HOW IS NEURALINK INSTALLED?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Neuralink will be using its specially developed robots to carry out
          the quick and precise insertion of the device into the cortex. The
          Neuralink robot will insert the module into your brain using a
          microscope and needles the size of 24 microns (a micron is
          one-millionth of a meter). These needles are so small that you canâ€™t
          easily spot them with the naked eye. The operation will require a 2mm
          incision which will be dilated up to 8mm. After the procedure is
          complete the exposed part of the skull will be covered with the
          chipset module. The installation procedure could take up to two hours
          according to Musk and the person could also be under partial
          anaesthesia during the process.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subhead">ADVANTAGES</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          - The machine will be able to help paraplegics with simple tasks like
          operating a phone or interacting with a computer. It may also be used
          to treat epilepsy. <br />
          - The device will also be able to help regain someoneâ€™s eyesight even
          if they have lost their optic nerve. <br />
          - Neuralink can also be used to restore memory, speech and movement of
          a paralysed person. <br />
          - It will also be able to help humans interact with each other without
          the need to actually talk. <br />
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">DISADVANTAGES</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          - If the device is connected to the internet how will we be protected
          against hackers who might try to steal data directly from our brains.
          <br />
          - Some unknown long-term impact on the brain from decomposition by the
          body of the electrode materials over time. <br />
          - Chip has the potential to decrease the work of the biological
          version of brain.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          The Neuralink project, if implemented successfully, would indeed
          change many things around us and it will boost the area of research
          and technology. Certain research and development take decades or even
          centuries to complete, so the knowledge and efforts of a scientist can
          be preserved and used further in his absence. At the same time, it is
          not an easy task to replicate the convoluted brain system into a
          computer chip. It may take several years to decades to accomplish
          this.
