          The Blue Brain project is the first comprehensive attempt to
          reverse-engineer the mammalian brain, in order to understand brain
          function and dysfunction through detailed supercomputer-based
          reconstructions and simulations. The project aims to build
          comprehensive digital reconstructions of the brain which can be used
          to study the nature of the brain. This, in turn, helps in
          understanding how human beings process emotions, thoughts, and give us
          deeper insight into the decision making power of the human brain.

          The blue brain project (BPP) makes use of the Blue Gene supercomputer
          developed by IBM to carry out simulations. Hence the project is named
          the “Blue Brain“. The project was founded by Henry Markram at the
          École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne,
          Switzerland way back in May 2005. EPFL is a research institute that
          specializes in natural sciences and engineering.Today scientists are
          carrying out research to create an artificial brain that can think,
          respond, take decisions and store information. The main aim is to
          upload a human brain into the computer, so that it can think, and make
          decisions without the presence of a human body. After death, this
          virtual brain can act as the man. So, even after the death of a
          person, we will not lose the knowledge, intelligence, emotions, and
          memories of a person and this can be used for various situations like
          to continue the pending work, to decide on something based on his/her
          area of expertise etc.

        <h2 class="subhead">WHAT IS VIRTUAL BRAIN?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          A virtual brain is an artificial brain. It can think like the natural
          brain, take decisions based on the past experience, and respond as the
          natural brain can. It is possible to do so by using supercomputers,
          with a huge amount of storage capacity, processing power and an
          interface between the human brain and this artificial one. Through
          this interface, the data stored in the natural brain can be uploaded
          into the computer. So the brain and the knowledge, intelligence of
          anyone can be preserved and used forever, even after the death of the
          person.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subhead">WHY DO WE NEED VIRTUAL BRAIN?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Today we are developed because of our intelligence. Intelligence is
          the inborn quality that cannot be created. Some people have this
          quality so that they can think to such an extent where others cannot
          reach. Human society would always need such intelligence and such an
          intelligent brain. But the intelligence is lost along with the person
          after death. Virtual brain is a solution to it. The brain and its
          intelligence can be alive even after death. We often face difficulties
          in remembering things such as people’s names, their birthdays, and the
          spellings of words, proper grammar, important dates, history facts,
          etc. A virtual brain can take away the extra stress we all face to
          remember things. It is a perfect technical solution to a very common
          human problem.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subhead">HOW DOES THE NATURAL BRAIN WORK?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          The human brain is a complex system consisting of recursive
          connectors. It is more complex than any circuitry in the world. The
          human brain is a multi-level system with 100 billion neurons (nerve
          cells) and 100 trillion synapses. A neuron is a cell designed to
          transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells
          whereas synapses help neurons to communicate with each other. The
          human ability to feel, interpret and even see is controlled, in
          computer-like calculations, by the magical nervous system. Yes, the
          nervous system is quite like a magic because we can’t see it, but it
          is working through electric impulses through our body. To understand
          this system, one has to know following three simple functions:-
          <br /><br />

          <strong> SENSORY INPUT</strong>: When our eyes see something or when
          our hands touch a warm surface, the sensory cells, also known as
          Neurons, send a message straight to our brain. This is called sensory
          input because we are putting things into our brain by way of senses.
          <br />
          <strong>INTEGRATION: </strong> Integration is best known as the
          interpretation of things like taste, touch, and sense which is
          possible because of our sensory cells, known as neurons. Billions of
          neurons work together to understand the change around us. <br />
          <strong>MOTOR OUTPUT : </strong> Once our brain understands the
          change, either by touching, tasting or via any other medium, then our
          brain sends a message through neurons to effector cells, muscles or
          gland cells, which actually work to perform our requests and act upon
          our environment. The word motor output is easily remembered if one
          should think that our putting something out into the environment
          through the use of a motor, like a muscle which does the work for our
          body
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">
          IS IT POSSIBLE TO COPY DATA FROM BRAIN TO THE COMPUTER?
        </h2>
        <p class="desc">
          The uploading is possible by the use of small robots known as the
          Nanobots. These robots are small enough to travel throughout our
          circulatory system. Traveling into the spine and brain, they will be
          able to monitor the activity and structure of our central nervous
          system. They will be able to provide an interface with computers.
          Nanobots could also carefully scan the structure of our brain,
          providing a complete readout of the connections. This information,
          when entered into a computer, could then continue to function as us.
          Thus, the entire data in the brain will be uploaded into the computer.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subhead">ADVANTAGES</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          - Even after the death of a person his intelligence can be used.
          <br />
          - This could boost study of animal behavior. That means by
          interpretation of the electric impulses from the brain of the animals,
          their thought process can be understood easily. <br />
          - It would allow the deaf to hear via direct nerve stimulation, and
          also be helpful for many psychological diseases. <br />
          - We could make use of the information of the brain that was uploaded
          into the computer and use it to provide a solution to mental disorder.
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">DISADVANTAGES</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          There could be new types of threats, this technology would bring.
          <br />

          - Increases the dependency on computer systems. <br />
          - Computer viruses will pose an increasingly critical threat. Data
          could be manipulated and used in wrong way. <br />
          - This may lead to human cloning and we cannot imagine how big this
          threat would be against nature. <br />
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          The blue brain project, if implemented successfully, would indeed
          change many things around us and it will boost the area of research
          and technology. Certain research and development take decades or even
          centuries to complete, so the knowledge and efforts of a scientist can
          be preserved and used further in his absence. At the same time, it is
          not an easy task to replicate the convoluted brain system into a
          computer. It may take several years to decades to accomplish this.
