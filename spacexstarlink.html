          Starlink is a satellite constellation development project by SpaceX,
          to develop a low-cost, high-performance satellite bus and requisite
          customer ground transceivers to implement a new spaceborne Internet
          communication system. SpaceX has said it will offer speeds of up to 1
          Gbit/s, with latencies between 25 ms and 35 ms. Those latencies would
          make SpaceX's service comparable to cable and fiber, while existing
          satellite broadband services have latencies of 600 ms or more,
          according to FCC measurements.

        <h2 class="subhead">HOW IT WORKS?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Each Starlink satellite is equipped with four powerful phased array
          antennas that are capable of an enormous amount of throughput when it
          comes to radio waves. Therefore, internet signal can be communicated
          up to a satellite and spread out through the network before being
          fired back down again to any location on Earth. Delivering internet
          via satellite is much more efficient because the signal travels 47%
          faster as a wave through the vacuum of space than it does being
          channelled along a fibre optic cable buried in the ground. From an
          infrastructure perspective, it also means there’s no need to lay vast
          amounts of cabling across parts of the world. Current satellites
          sending internet signals are around 22,236 miles (35,786 km) above the
          Earth. This results in a time delay in sending and receiving data.
          Starlink satellites are smaller and orbit closer, meaning they can
          carry and triangulate data much faster.

        <h2 class="subhead">ADVANTAGES</h2>

        <p class="desc">
          <strong>High-Speed Broadband</strong> <br />
          Estimates suggest that Starlink may offer 1Gb/s download speeds once
          the system is fully operational, far exceeding the beta’s speeds of
          50-150Mb/s. Even at the lowest speeds, Starlink's beta is still able
          to provide 10x the minimum requirements for HD streaming. <br />
          <strong> Low Latency</strong> <br />
          Starlink's satellites will be in low Earth orbit, just 550km above the
          Earth's surface and 60x lower than existing networks. This greatly
          reduces the distance signals need to travel. A lower orbit ensures
          drastically lower latency, with Starlink expecting just 20-40ms of
          latency, compared to the 600ms of traditional satellites. Low latency
          brings with it the ability or video calls and online gaming for those
          in areas without reliable internet. <br />

          <strong>Customer Base </strong> <br />
          Starlink has the potential to bring broadband to billions, as it
          doesn’t rely on ground infrastructure Starlink can bypass geographic
          and economic boundaries which typically constrain the expansion of
          broadband. The network will have a potential customer base spanning
          not only the developing world but also the developed world, as many in
          rural regions still struggle with poor quality internet connections.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subhead">DISADVANTAGES</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          <strong> Orbital Traffic</strong><br />
          With increasing satellite numbers come fears that crashes will become
          a greater risk. With a potential fleet of 42,000 satellites,
          increasing overall numbers by 15x, Starlink could pose a threat to
          existing and future orbital projects. The European Space Agency
          reported in September 2019 that it had performed evasive manoeuvres,
          for the first time, to avoid a Starlink satellite. However, SpaceX has
          sought to relieve fears by incorporating an automatic avoidance system
          using data provided by NORAD, to prevent any further incidents. <br />
          <strong>Space Debris</strong> <br />
          Alongside traffic, debris left by damaged or retired satellites, poses
          an increasing threat to orbital safety. The emergence of 'space junk'
          has the potential to obliterate the world's orbital capabilities
          through exponential chain reactions. SpaceX promises that Starlink's
          low orbiting altitude will prevent debris, as 95% of the satellite is
          designed to burn up in the atmosphere once decommissioned. SpaceX has
          also made it clear that future Starlink satellites will burn up
          completely. <br />
          <strong>Brightening the Night Sky </strong> <br />
          Astronomers are particularly concerned that the scale and low orbit of
          the project will fill the night sky with reflections, ruining
          stargazing conditions. SpaceX has responded to this criticism, seeking
          ways to reduce the visibility of their satellites, such as an
          experimental system called DarkSat, which involved blackening as much
          of the satellite's reflective surfaces as possible. While DarkSat did
          result in a 55% reduction in visibility it has proved unsustainable
          due to conduction problems. Future Starlink designs are set to feature
          visors, limiting the amount of reflected light.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subhead">IS STARLINK REALLY WORTH IT?</h2>
        <p class="desc">
          Despite competition and technical challenges, Starlink appears to be
          poised to provide a revolutionary global service, offering high-speed
          broadband across the globe. The use of SpaceX's reusable rockets is
          seeing 60 satellites put into orbit per mission, rapidly expanding the
          network's size and capabilities.The growth potential is huge, provided
          SpaceX successfully manages to scale up the network and reduce prices.
          However, it is important to note that Starlink is not intended to
          replace existing ADSL, Fibre Optic, or Cable services, as it simply
          cannot compete in terms of speed or latency. Instead, Starlink is
          aimed at connecting those without access to these services, a
          potential game-changer for remote areas and the developing world.
